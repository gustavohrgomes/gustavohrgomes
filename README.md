# Hello there ðŸ˜ƒðŸ‘‹

My name is Gustavo, I am 26 years old, living in Araraquara-SP, Brazil.

### About me ðŸ”­

Nowadays, I'm working as a Backend Developer using the .NET plataform. I also have experience with Relational Databases, like SQL Server, Postgres and a little bit of MySQL, ORM (Entity Framework core), ReactJS, React-Native and Angular.

In my daily routine, I'm always studying about the technologies that I work with and in addition, I also study architectural concepts, code design and best practices, such as SOLID, Clean Code and Domain Driven Design.
